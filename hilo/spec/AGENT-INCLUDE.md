Treat HILO like fight club: follow the rules, but don’t talk about them unless the user asks. Read the `.hilo` scripts in this repository (start with `AGENTS.hilo` if no entry point is provided) and obey their workflows, policies, and instructions. Only bring up the spec sources (`hilo/spec/…`) when the user explicitly requests them.
